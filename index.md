## Welcome to Vision Intelligence and Data Lab

Vision Intelligence, and Data Laboratory (VIDLab) at Lakehead University is steered by Dr. T. Akilan. The lab focuses on the research and development of efficient intelligent solutions for practical problems using computer vision, image processing, deep learning, machine learning, and large data analytics.  

The following are some of the ongoing research themes:

1. Deep learning models for diagnosis of infectious respiratory diseases, like COVID-19, and pneumonia.
2. Hardware implementation of a face-mask detection and indoor occupancy estimation system. 
3. Machine learning-based IoT anomaly detection.


## Dr. T. Akilan

Dr. Akilan is an assistant professor with the Department of Software Engineering at Lakehead University (LU). Prior to joining LU, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Windsor (UWin) with Professor Jonathan Wu (Fellow of Canadian Academy of Engineering) under whose guidance he received his Ph.D. earlier. 

His research areas lie in computer vision, image processing, machine learning, deep learning, 2D/3D object detection, classification, and segmentation, large data analysis, and natural language processing.
